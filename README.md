Open source Arduino projects

'erom' is a library made for easing access to EEPROM on Arduino based systems.
The library includes:
  1) Full EEPROM access with tools made to reduce write to flash operations
  2) Type and variables management assistance for memory allocation, reading and writing procedures
  3) EEPROM storage verification system, that is based upon application id and version number, for avoiding erroneous data reads
